Description: A tool for building projects that are visually consistent,
    accessible, and easy to maintain. It provides functions for managing
    branding assets, applying organization-wide themes using '_brand.yml',
    and setting up new projects with accessibility features and correct
    branding. It supports 'Quarto', 'Shiny', and 'RMarkdown' projects, and
    integrates with 'ggplot2' and 'plotly' for producing branded graphics
    and visualizations.
