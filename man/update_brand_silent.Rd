\description{
Non-interactive version of get_brand() for use in .Rprofile
}
\details{
This function checks if the local _brand.yml file differs from the remote version
and automatically updates it if needed. It returns a message indicating the result
but does not prompt for user input.

This function is primarily intended for internal use by the .Rprofile automation,
but is exported so it can be called from there.
