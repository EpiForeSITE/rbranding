\usage{
install_rbranding(project_path = ".")
}
\arguments{
\item{project_path}{Character string specifying the project directory. Default is "." (current directory).}
}

No return value. Side effects: creates or modifies .Rprofile in project_path.
}
\description{
Adds code to .Rprofile that automatically checks and updates the _brand.yml file when R starts.
}
\details{
This function modifies or creates an .Rprofile file in the specified project directory.
The added code will automatically check for updates to the _brand.yml file each time
R starts (unless --vanilla is used).

The code block is wrapped with hash markers including a checksum for easy identification
and updates. All operations are wrapped in local() to avoid polluting the global environment
and in tryCatch() for safe error handling.
